            ERP by Layer 8 is a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning system designed for modern businesses.
            Built from the ground up with Go, it provides a unified platform for managing all aspects of your
            organization.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unlike traditional ERP systems that are bloated and difficult to customize, Layer 8 ERP is
            lightweight, modular, and designed for extensibility. Each module integrates seamlessly with
            the others while maintaining the flexibility to be used independently.

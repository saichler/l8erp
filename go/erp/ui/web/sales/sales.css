/* SALES STYLES - Entry Point */
/* ============================================ */
/*
 * The Sales module reuses the shared HCM layout classes
 * (hcm-section, hcm-module-tabs, hcm-subnav, etc.) since they represent
 * generic module layout patterns.
 *
 * Any Sales-specific style overrides can be added here.
 *
 * Load order in app.html:
 *   1. HCM layout styles (shared)
 *   2. sales.css (this file)

/* Any additional Sales-specific styles can be added here */

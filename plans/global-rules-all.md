# 1. Plan Approval Workflow

**Source:** `plan-approval-workflow.md`

## Rule
When a plan is created, it MUST be written to the `./plans` directory in the project root. Do NOT ask the user for approval directly — the user needs to share the plan with their peers first. Wait for the user to explicitly confirm that the plan has been approved before implementing it.

## Process
1. Write the plan to `./plans/<descriptive-name>.md`
2. Inform the user that the plan is ready at that path
3. **Stop and wait** — do not implement, do not ask "should I proceed?", do not call ExitPlanMode
4. Only begin implementation after the user explicitly says the plan is approved

---

# 2. Code Maintainability Standards

**Source:** `maintainability.md`

## File Size
Files that are over 500 lines of code are not maintainable, please make sure to refactor them and break them into smaller files logically.

### File Size Check (CRITICAL)
After ANY edit that adds more than 10 lines to a file, check the file's total line count.
If the file is approaching 450 lines, proactively split it before continuing.
If the file exceeds 500 lines, STOP and refactor immediately before proceeding.

## No Duplicate Code
Avoid duplicate code. Always check for existing utilities, functions, or components before writing new code. Consolidate duplicates into shared modules.

## Future-Proof Design
The ERP system has more modules that are not implemented yet. When designing components, consider that future modules (Financial, SCM, Manufacturing, Sales, CRM, Projects, BI, Documents, E-Commerce, Compliance, System) will follow similar patterns. Design shared components to be reusable across all modules.

## Read Before Implementing
When asked to implement something similar to an existing component, you MUST read ALL the code of the referenced component(s) first. Do not make any assumptions. Read every file, understand every pattern, and only then implement following the exact same patterns.
- Use the Read tool to read the file completely. Show the key interfaces and props found. Then implement.

## Component Integration Analysis
When implementing support for a component, perform deep analysis first:
- Understand all initialization arguments and configuration options
- Understand how endpoints are constructed (if applicable)
- Understand how L8Query is constructed for paging, filtering, and sorting (if supported)
- Only proceed with implementation after full understanding is documented

## Demo Directory
The `/go/demo/` directory is auto-generated and used for local testing only. Do not edit code in that directory. The source of truth is `/go/erp/ui/web/`.

## ServiceName
ServiceName should not be larger than 10 characters.

## ServiceArea
ServiceArea should be the same for Services under the same Module.

## ServiceCallback Auto-Generate ID
Every `*ServiceCallback.go` must auto-generate the primary key ID on POST (Add) operations. In the `Before()` method, insert `common.GenerateID(&entity.PrimaryKeyField)` between the type assertion and the `validate()` call, guarded by `if action == ifs.POST`. The primary key field name is found in the corresponding `*Service.go` file's `SetPrimaryKeys("XxxId")` call. This ensures that Add operations from the UI (which don't include the primary key field in the form) succeed without "XxxId is required" errors.

## UI Type Registration
When creating a service, the model type must be registered in the UI. Add it to the appropriate `register<Module>Types` function in `go/erp/ui/main.go`. Follow the existing pattern: use `introspect.AddPrimaryKeyDecorator` to mark the primary key field, then call `registry.Register` with the type. If a `register<Module>Types` function doesn't exist for your module, create one following the pattern of `registerFinTypes` or `registerScmTypes`.

## UI Endpoint Verification (CRITICAL)
When creating or updating UI module config files (`*-config.js`), you MUST verify every endpoint against the actual service definitions:
1. **Before writing any endpoint**, run: `grep "ServiceName = " /path/to/erp/<module>/*/*.go` to get ALL actual service names
2. **The endpoint in the config MUST exactly match** the `ServiceName` constant from the corresponding `*Service.go` file
3. **Never guess or abbreviate service names** - always verify against the source of truth
4. **Common mistakes to avoid**:
   - Using `MfgWO` instead of `MfgWorkOrd`
   - Using `MfgQP` instead of `MfgQCPlan`
   - Abbreviating names differently than the service definition
5. **After creating a config file**, verify all endpoints by comparing against the grep output

This rule exists because mismatched endpoints cause 404 errors at runtime and are difficult to debug. This bug has occurred multiple times (Sales, MFG modules) and MUST be prevented.

## Vendor All Third-Party Dependencies
All third-party dependencies must be vendored. After adding or updating any dependency, run `go mod vendor` to ensure the `vendor/` directory is up to date. Never rely on module cache alone — the vendor directory is the source of truth for third-party code.

## Guidelines
- Each file should have a single responsibility
- Use logical module/package organization
- Check for existing shared utilities before creating new ones

## Duplication Prevention Rules

### Second Instance Rule
When creating a second instance of any pattern (e.g., a second module, a second similar component), extract a shared abstraction immediately. Do not copy a file and replace identifiers. The second consumer is the forcing function for abstraction — do not wait for a third.

### Copy-Paste Detection
If the only differences between two files are identifiers, names, or configuration values, the logic MUST be extracted into a shared component that accepts those values as parameters. Before creating a new module or feature file, diff it against the nearest equivalent. If the diff shows only namespace changes (e.g., `HCM` to `FIN`), string literal changes, or data differences — the logic is generic and must be shared.

### Configuration vs. Logic Separation
Module-specific files should contain only data (configuration, definitions, mappings). All behavioral logic (CRUD operations, navigation, service lookups, DOM manipulation, event handlers, fetch calls) must live in shared components. A module consists of:
- A config file (unique data)
- Data files (enums, columns, forms — unique per sub-module)
- An init file that calls a shared factory (~10 lines)

### Shared Components Before the Second Module
The shared abstraction layer must be created as part of building the first module, or at latest refactored out before the second module ships. Never ship a second module by copying the first. If the first module embedded behavioral logic, the second module's implementation must include extracting that logic into shared components.

### New Module Checklist
Before creating a new module, verify it only needs configuration files:
- Does it need its own navigation logic? → No, use the shared navigation component.
- Does it need its own CRUD handlers? → No, use the shared CRUD component.
- Does it need its own form wrapper? → No, use the shared form framework.
- Does it need its own service lookup? → No, use the shared service registry.
If any answer is "yes," fix the shared component — do not work around it with a module-specific copy.

### Audit on Every Module Addition
When adding a new module, diff all existing module-level files. Any file with >80% similarity across modules is a refactoring candidate that MUST be addressed before the new module ships.

### Facades Are a Code Smell
If a wrapper file delegates 100% of its calls to another component, it should not exist. Delete it and reference the shared component directly. A file that only re-exports or proxies another component is dead weight.

### Backport Improvements Immediately
When a newer module improves on a pattern from an older module, the improvement must be backported to all existing modules immediately. Do not leave different implementations of the same logic across modules.

### Measure Boilerplate
If adding a new module requires more than 50 lines of structural/behavioral code (excluding domain-specific data like configs, enums, columns, forms), the shared abstraction layer needs improvement before proceeding.

### Document the Module Creation Recipe
Maintain a "How to Add a New Module" guide that specifies exactly which files to create and which shared components to use. If the guide says "copy an existing module," the architecture has failed. The guide should say: create config, create data files, create init file with a factory call. No copying. No behavioral code. Configuration only.

# 3. Prime Object Rules

**Source:** `prime-object-references.md`

## Rule 1: What IS a Prime Object

A **Prime Object** is an entity that can exist independently — it has its own identity, its own lifecycle, and is meaningful on its own without a parent. Prime Objects get their own service (service directory under `go/erp/<module>/`).

### Prime Object Test (ALL must be true)
Before creating a new service for a type, it MUST pass ALL of these:

1. **Independence**: Can this entity exist on its own without a parent? If deleting the parent makes this entity meaningless, it is NOT a Prime Object.
2. **Own lifecycle**: Does this entity have a lifecycle independent of any parent? If it is always created, updated, and deleted as part of a parent, it is NOT a Prime Object.
3. **Direct query need**: Do users need to query this entity across all parents? (e.g., "show all employees" makes sense; "show all order lines across all orders" does NOT — you always view lines within an order.)
4. **No parent ID dependency**: Does this entity's primary identity stand alone? If the entity's meaning requires knowing which parent it belongs to (e.g., "line 3 of order SO-001"), it is NOT a Prime Object.

### What is NOT a Prime Object (embedded child types)

These are types that belong to a parent and should be defined as `repeated` fields inside the parent's protobuf message — NOT as separate services:

- **Line items**: OrderLine, InvoiceLine, BomLine, QuotationLine
- **Entries/details**: TimesheetEntry, ExpenseEntry, LaborEntry, ChangeDetail
- **Components/operations**: RoutingOperation, WorkOrderOp, WorkflowStep
- **Assignments/members**: TerritoryAssign, CampaignMember, TeamMember
- **Child records**: CaseComment, LeadActivity, DeliveryConfirm, BackOrder
- **Configuration children**: PriceListEntry, QuantityBreak, KpiThreshold
- **Status/history records**: OrderStatusHistory, Checkpoint, AuditTrail

**Key indicator**: If the entity has a `parent_id` field (typically field 2) that is always required and always references a single parent type, it is a child — not a Prime Object.

### Correct pattern for child types

```protobuf
// CORRECT: Child types are embedded in the parent
message SalesOrder {
    string sales_order_id = 1;
    string order_number = 2;
    // ... parent fields ...
    repeated SalesOrderLine lines = 20;          // Embedded child
    repeated SalesOrderAllocation allocations = 21;  // Embedded child
    erp.AuditInfo audit_info = 30;
}

// Child type — has its own ID but NO service, NO List type
message SalesOrderLine {
    string line_id = 1;        // Own ID for addressing within parent
    string item_id = 2;        // Reference to another Prime Object (ScmItem)
    int32 quantity = 3;
    erp.Money unit_price = 4;
}

// WRONG: Child type as separate service
// go/erp/sales/salesorderlines/SalesOrderLineService.go  ← SHOULD NOT EXIST
```

### Examples

| Entity | Prime Object? | Why |
|--------|:---:|-----|
| Employee | Yes | Independent identity, own lifecycle, queried directly |
| SalesOrder | Yes | Independent document, own status lifecycle |
| Department | Yes | Organizational unit, exists independently |
| SalesOrderLine | **No** | Meaningless without its order, always viewed within order context |
| JournalEntryLine | **No** | Debit/credit line within a journal entry |
| MfgBomLine | **No** | Component within a BOM, not independent |
| CrmCaseComment | **No** | Comment on a case, meaningless alone |
| BenefitPlan | Yes | Plan definition exists independently |
| CoverageOption | **No** | Option within a benefit plan |

### Existing correct example: HCM BenefitPlan

```protobuf
message BenefitPlan {
    string plan_id = 1;
    // ... plan fields ...
    repeated CoverageOption coverage_options = 14;  // Embedded child (no service)
    repeated PlanCost costs = 15;                    // Embedded child (no service)
    EligibilityRules eligibility = 16;              // Embedded child (no service)
}
```

`CoverageOption`, `PlanCost`, and `EligibilityRules` do NOT have service directories. They are managed entirely through the `BenefitPlan` service. This is the correct pattern.

## Rule 2: Cross-References Between Prime Objects

Prime Objects MUST NEVER contain direct struct references (`*OtherPrimeType` or `[]*OtherPrimeType`) to other Prime Objects. Prime Objects refer to each other **ONLY via ID fields** (string).

### Why This Is Critical
When the introspector inspects a type, it recursively inspects all nested struct fields. If Prime Object A contains `[]*PrimeObjectB`, inspecting A creates a node for B in the introspector's `typeToNode` map WITHOUT B's primary key decorator. When B's service later activates and adds its decorator, it goes to a different node in `pathToNode`. This causes "Decorator Not Found" errors at runtime because `ElementToQuery` uses `NodeByTypeName` (reads `typeToNode`) and finds the old undecorated node.

This is NOT just a test issue — it breaks the ORM query path for any Get-by-filter operation on the referenced type.

### Correct Pattern
```protobuf
// WRONG - Direct reference to another Prime Object
message BenefitEnrollment {
    repeated Dependent covered_dependents = 15;  // BAD: Dependent is a Prime Object
}

// CORRECT - Reference via ID only
message BenefitEnrollment {
    repeated string covered_dependent_ids = 15;  // GOOD: Reference by ID
}
```

### What Is Allowed
- Prime Objects MAY contain fields of **shared/common types** (e.g., `erp.Money`, `erp.Address`, `erp.AuditInfo`, `erp.ContactInfo`, `erp.DateRange`)
- Prime Objects MAY contain `repeated` fields of **embedded child types** (types without their own service, e.g., `SalesOrderLine`, `CoverageOption`, `PlanCost`)
- Prime Objects MAY reference other Prime Objects via **string ID fields** (e.g., `employee_id`, `department_id`)

## Rule 3: UI Implications of Prime vs Child

The Prime Object classification directly determines how an entity appears in the UI. Getting this wrong creates standalone UI entries (config, columns, forms, nav) for entities that should only appear inline within their parent's form.

### Prime Object UI Stack (standalone)
A Prime Object gets ALL of the following:
- **Config entry** in `*-config.js` (service key, model, endpoint)
- **Column definitions** in `*-columns.js` (table columns for list view)
- **Form definition** in `*-forms.js` (standalone create/edit form)
- **Nav entry** in desktop section HTML and mobile `layer8m-nav-config.js`
- **Type registration** in `go/erp/ui/main.go`
- **Reference registry entry** (if other forms reference it via `lookupModel`)
- **Mock data generator** with its own ID slice in `store.go`

### Child Type UI (inline within parent)
A child type gets NONE of the above. Instead:
- **No config entry** — not a standalone service
- **No column definitions** — not shown in its own table
- **No standalone form** — not independently created/edited
- **No nav entry** — not navigable on its own
- **No type registration** — not a registered Prime Object
- **Inline table in parent form** — child rows displayed via `f.inlineTable()` within the parent's form definition
- **Mock data inline** — generated as part of the parent's `repeated` field, not as a separate generator

### Correct UI Pattern for Child Types

```javascript
// Parent form embeds child rows via inlineTable
SalesOrder: f.form('Sales Order', [
    f.section('Order Details', [
        ...f.text('orderNumber', 'Order #', true),
        ...f.reference('customerId', 'Customer', 'Customer', true),
    ]),
    f.section('Order Lines', [
        ...f.inlineTable('lines', 'Order Lines', [
            { key: 'lineId', label: 'Line ID', hidden: true },
            { key: 'itemId', label: 'Item', type: 'reference', lookupModel: 'ScmItem' },
            { key: 'quantity', label: 'Qty', type: 'number' },
            { key: 'unitPrice', label: 'Unit Price', type: 'money' },
        ]),
    ]),
])
```

### Wrong UI Pattern (child as standalone)

```javascript
// WRONG: Child type has its own config entry
{ key: 'salesorderlines', label: 'Order Lines', model: 'SalesOrderLine' }

// WRONG: Child type has its own form
SalesOrderLine: f.form('Order Line', [
    f.section('Line Details', [
        ...f.reference('salesOrderId', 'Sales Order', 'SalesOrder', true),  // parent ref
        ...f.reference('itemId', 'Item', 'ScmItem', true),
        ...f.number('quantity', 'Quantity', true),
    ]),
])
```

### Why This Matters
When a child is wrongly given standalone UI, users see it as an independent navigable entity — they can create "orphan" lines without an order, browse lines across all orders (which is never useful), and the parent form shows no children. The correct UX is always: navigate to the parent, see its children inline, edit children within the parent context.

## Verification

### Before creating a new service
1. Apply the Prime Object Test (Rule 1) — does the entity pass ALL four criteria?
2. If it has a parent_id field that is always required, it is a child — embed it in the parent instead
3. If unsure, default to embedded child. It is easy to promote a child to a Prime Object later; it is painful to demote a Prime Object to a child (requires deleting services, updating UI, etc.)

### Before creating or modifying a protobuf message
1. Check if any `*Type` or `repeated Type` fields reference a Prime Object
2. If yes, replace with the corresponding ID field(s)
3. After fixing proto, regenerate bindings, update mock generators, forms, and columns

```bash
# Find all Prime Object type names
for dir in $(find go/erp/ -mindepth 3 -maxdepth 3 -name '*Service.go'); do
    grep -oP 'type \K\w+(?= struct)' "$(dirname "$dir")/../../../types/$(basename "$(dirname "$(dirname "$dir")")")/"*.pb.go 2>/dev/null
done

# Check for direct references between Prime Objects in proto types
grep -rn '\[\]\*\|^\s*\*' go/types/**/*.pb.go | grep 'protobuf:' | grep -v 'List     \[' | grep -v 'erp\.\|l8api\.\|l8web\.'
```

## Historical Context
- **Rule 2** was discovered when `BenefitEnrollment.CoveredDependents []*Dependent` caused "Decorator Not Found in Dependent" errors.
- **Rule 1** was established after an audit found ~134 child entities (order lines, BOM lines, invoice lines, case comments, fiscal periods, bins, etc.) incorrectly implemented as separate Prime Objects with their own services across 10 modules. These should have been embedded `repeated` fields in their parent types from the start.
- **Rule 3** was added because those ~134 child entities each had a full standalone UI stack (config, columns, forms, nav entries) that should not have existed — children should only appear as inline tables within their parent's form.

# 4. Protobuf Generation

**Source:** `protobuf-generation.md`

## Rule
Whenever ANY `.proto` file is created, modified, or removed, you MUST run `make-bindings.sh` to regenerate ALL protobuf bindings. The script handles everything: it generates `.pb.go` files and places them in the correct directory at `/go/types/`. This step is essential before any other steps so there are no mistakes and issues.

**This is mandatory** — never skip regeneration. Even a single field addition or removal in a `.proto` file requires running the full script.

## Process

1. **Create/Update/Remove .proto files** in `/proto/` directory
2. **Update make-bindings.sh** if new proto files were added or removed
3. **Run make-bindings.sh** to regenerate ALL Go bindings:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project/proto && ./make-bindings.sh
   ```
   The script generates all bindings and moves them to `/go/types/` automatically.
4. **Verify generation** by checking `/go/types/<module>/` for .pb.go files
5. **Build dependent code** to ensure types are correct before proceeding

## Why This Matters
- Generated .pb.go files contain the actual Go struct definitions
- Field names in generated code may differ from what you expect
- Building code that uses these types before generation will fail
- Mock data generators, services, and UI code all depend on these types

## Common Issues

### TTY Error
If running in a non-interactive shell and you see `the input device is not a TTY`:
```bash
sed 's/-it /-i /g' make-bindings.sh | bash
```

### Field Name Verification
After generation, verify field names by checking the .pb.go files:
```bash
grep -A 30 "type TypeName struct" go/types/<module>/*.pb.go | grep 'json:"'
```

## Checklist Before Proceeding
- [ ] All .proto files created/updated
- [ ] make-bindings.sh updated with new proto files
- [ ] make-bindings.sh executed successfully
- [ ] .pb.go files exist in /go/types/<module>/
- [ ] Dependent code builds: `go build ./...`

---

# 5. Protobuf List Type Convention

**Source:** `proto-list-convention.md`

## Rule
All protobuf list/collection message types must follow this exact pattern:

```protobuf
message SomeEntityList {
  repeated SomeEntity list = 1;
  l8api.L8MetaData metadata = 2;
}
```

## Key Points
- The repeated field MUST be named `list` (not `items`, `entries`, `data`, etc.)
- The `l8api.L8MetaData metadata` field MUST be included as field 2
- This pattern is required by the Layer8 framework for proper serialization and iteration

## Why This Matters
The Layer8 framework expects the `list` field name when iterating over collection types. Using a different field name (like `items`) will cause runtime errors such as:
```
invalid <TypeName> type
```

## Verification
Before creating new proto files, verify the pattern against existing modules:
```bash
grep -A3 "List {" proto/*.proto | head -20
```

## Example
```protobuf
// CORRECT
message EcomCategoryList {
  repeated EcomCategory list = 1;
  l8api.L8MetaData metadata = 2;
}

// WRONG - will cause runtime errors
message EcomCategoryList {
  repeated EcomCategory items = 1;
}
```

# 6. JavaScript Protobuf Field Name Mapping

**Source:** `js-protobuf-field-names.md`

## Field Name Format
JavaScript code must use the exact JSON field names from protobuf definitions. Protobuf field names use `snake_case` which converts to `camelCase` in JSON.

## Finding the Correct Field Name
Before using a field name in JavaScript (reference registries, column definitions, forms, etc.):

1. Locate the protobuf type in `go/types/{module}/*.pb.go`
2. Find the field definition and look at the `json` tag
3. Use the JSON tag value (the part after `json:"` and before the comma)

## Example
For ScmWarehouse:
```go
// In go/types/scm/scm-warehouse.pb.go
type ScmWarehouse struct {
    WarehouseId string `protobuf:"..." json:"warehouseId,omitempty"`
    Code        string `protobuf:"..." json:"code,omitempty"`        // <-- JSON name is "code"
    Name        string `protobuf:"..." json:"name,omitempty"`
    ...
}
```

JavaScript should use:
```javascript
selectColumns: ['warehouseId', 'code', 'name'],  // Correct
displayFormat: function(item) {
    return item.code + ' - ' + item.name;        // Correct
}
```

**NOT** `warehouseCode` (incorrect - field doesn't exist)

## Common Naming Patterns
| Protobuf Field | JSON Name | Common Mistake |
|----------------|-----------|----------------|
| `warehouse_id` | `warehouseId` | `warehouseID` |
| `code` | `code` | `warehouseCode` |
| `is_active` | `isActive` | `active` |
| `audit_info` | `auditInfo` | `audit` |

## CRITICAL: "Number" Field Pitfall

**DO NOT assume all "number" fields are named the same way across models.**

Different models use different naming conventions for their number/identifier fields:

| Model | Correct Field | Common Mistake |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `MfgWorkOrder` | `workOrderNumber` | `orderNumber` |
| `MfgProductionOrder` | `orderNumber` | (correct) |
| `SalesOrder` | `orderNumber` | (correct) |
| `ScmPurchaseOrder` | `orderNumber` | (correct) |
| `MfgBom` | `bomNumber` | `bomId` |
| `MfgRouting` | `routingNumber` | `routingId` |

**Always verify** by checking the protobuf definition:
```bash
grep -A15 "type MfgWorkOrder struct" go/types/mfg/*.pb.go | grep -E "Number|number"
```

**Error symptom**: Server log shows:
```
cannot find property for col <model>.<field>:Unknown attribute <model>.<field>
```

## Verification Steps
Before adding field references in JavaScript:
1. Search the .pb.go file: `grep -A 20 "type TypeName struct" go/types/{module}/*.pb.go`
2. List all JSON field names from the struct
3. Use exact matches in JavaScript code

## Files That Reference Field Names
- `erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-*.js` - Reference lookups
- `erp/ui/web/l8ui/m/js/layer8m-reference-registry.js` - Mobile reference lookups
- `erp/ui/web/{module}/js/*-columns.js` - Table column definitions
- `erp/ui/web/{module}/js/*-form.js` - Form field definitions

## Quick Field Name Lookup
```bash
# List all fields for a type
grep -A 30 "type ScmWarehouse struct" go/types/scm/*.pb.go | grep 'json:"'
```

---

# 7. JS Column and Form Field Name Verification

**Source:** `js-column-field-verification.md`

## Rule
Every field name used in JavaScript column definitions (`*-columns.js`) and form definitions (`*-forms.js`) MUST be verified against the protobuf JSON field name before use. Never guess, assume, or invent field names. This applies to ALL JS code that references data model fields.

## Root Cause
During refactoring (column factory, form factory, enum factory conversions), field names were written from memory or guessed instead of being verified against the protobuf `.pb.go` files. This introduced ~450 silent field name mismatches across 9 modules, causing empty table cells throughout the UI. The data existed on the server but was invisible because JS accessed non-existent properties.

## MANDATORY: Protobuf-First Workflow
When writing or refactoring ANY JS file that references data model fields:

1. **BEFORE writing any field name**, read the protobuf struct:
   ```bash
   grep -A 40 "type ModelName struct" go/types/<module>/*.pb.go
   ```

2. Extract the protobuf JSON field name from the `protobuf` tag (`json=camelCaseName`):
   ```
   protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=projected_inflows,json=projectedInflows,proto3"
   ```
   The correct JS field name is `projectedInflows`.

3. **ONLY use field names that exist in the protobuf struct.** Never invent fields.

4. **After writing**, verify every field name in the file against the protobuf struct. Every `key:` value and every `item.xxx` reference MUST have an exact match in the protobuf.

## Common Mismatch Categories
| Category | Example Wrong | Example Correct |
|---|---|---|
| Singular vs Plural | `projectedInflow` | `projectedInflows` |
| Abbreviated | `allocatedQty` | `allocatedQuantity` |
| Missing prefix | `reason` | `reasonCode` |
| Fabricated field | `salePrice` | `disposalProceeds` |
| Timestamp convention | `signedAt` | `signedDate` |
| Wrong prefix | `fromDepartment` | `fromDepartmentId` |
| Semantic guess | `oldValue` | `previousValue` |

## Applies To
- Desktop column files: `go/erp/ui/web/*/**/*-columns.js`
- Desktop form files: `go/erp/ui/web/*/**/*-forms.js`
- Mobile column files: `go/erp/ui/web/m/js/**/*-columns.js`
- Mobile form files: `go/erp/ui/web/m/js/**/*-forms.js`
- Any `render: (item) => fn(item.fieldName)` usage
- Reference registries

## Error Symptom
Table rows appear but specific columns are empty (no data, no error). The failure is completely silent — no console errors are produced. This makes it extremely hard to debug without checking the protobuf definitions.

## This Rule Is Non-Negotiable
During refactoring, it is tempting to write field names from memory to save time. DO NOT DO THIS. Always read the `.pb.go` file first. The cost of checking is seconds; the cost of not checking is hundreds of broken columns across the UI.

# 8. JavaScript UI Model Names Must Match Protobuf Types

**Source:** `js-protobuf-model-names.md`

## Rule
JavaScript UI model names MUST exactly match the protobuf type names. Do not abbreviate, omit prefixes, or modify the names.

## Why This Matters
The server uses protobuf type names to look up table schemas. If the JavaScript UI sends a different model name, the server returns "Cannot find node for table X" errors.

## Common Mistakes

### Module Prefix Omission
Protobuf types often have a module prefix (e.g., `Sales`, `Scm`, `Fin`). Never omit it:

| Wrong (JS) | Correct (JS) | Protobuf Type |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| `ReturnOrder` | `SalesReturnOrder` | `SalesReturnOrder` |
| `CustomerHierarchy` | `SalesCustomerHierarchy` | `SalesCustomerHierarchy` |
| `PurchaseOrder` | `ScmPurchaseOrder` | `ScmPurchaseOrder` |
| `Warehouse` | `ScmWarehouse` | `ScmWarehouse` |

### Where Model Names Appear in JS

1. **Config files** (`*-config.js`):
   ```javascript
   { key: 'returns', label: 'Returns', model: 'SalesReturnOrder' }  // Correct
   { key: 'returns', label: 'Returns', model: 'ReturnOrder' }       // WRONG
   ```

2. **Form definitions** (`*-forms.js`):
   ```javascript
   SalesOrders.forms = {
       SalesReturnOrder: { ... }  // Correct - key must match protobuf type
       ReturnOrder: { ... }       // WRONG
   }
   ```

3. **Column definitions** (`*-columns.js`):
   ```javascript
   SalesOrders.columns = {
       SalesReturnOrder: [ ... ]  // Correct
       ReturnOrder: [ ... ]       // WRONG
   }
   ```

4. **Primary key mappings**:
   ```javascript
   SalesOrders.primaryKeys = {
       SalesReturnOrder: 'returnOrderId'  // Correct
       ReturnOrder: 'returnOrderId'       // WRONG
   }
   ```

5. **Reference lookups** (`lookupModel` in forms):
   ```javascript
   { key: 'warehouseId', type: 'reference', lookupModel: 'ScmWarehouse' }  // Correct
   { key: 'warehouseId', type: 'reference', lookupModel: 'Warehouse' }     // WRONG
   ```

6. **Navigation configs** (mobile/desktop nav):
   ```javascript
   { model: 'SalesReturnOrder' }  // Correct
   { model: 'ReturnOrder' }       // WRONG
   ```

## Verification Process

Before implementing UI for a module:

1. **Find the protobuf types**:
   ```bash
   grep "type Sales" go/types/sales/*.pb.go | grep "struct {"
   ```

2. **List all type names**:
   ```bash
   grep -oP "type \K\w+" go/types/sales/*.pb.go | grep -v "^is" | sort -u
   ```

3. **Use exact names** from the protobuf output in all JavaScript files.

## Error Symptom
```
(Error) - Cannot find node for table ReturnOrder
```
This means JS sent `ReturnOrder` but the protobuf type is `SalesReturnOrder`.

## Files to Check When Adding a Module

- `*-config.js` - service definitions with `model` property
- `*-forms.js` - form definition keys and `lookupModel` references
- `*-columns.js` - column definition keys
- `*-renderers.js` - any model references
- `layer8m-nav-config.js` - mobile navigation model references
- `reference-registry*.js` - reference registry keys

# 9. Nested Protobuf Types in Form Definitions

**Source:** `money-field-type-mapping.md`

## Rule
Before using any form factory method (`f.text()`, `f.number()`, etc.) for a field, you MUST check its protobuf type. If the protobuf type is a nested object (pointer to another struct like `*erp.Something`), a repeated field (`[]string`, `[]*Type`), or a map (`map[string]string`), you CANNOT use scalar form methods like `f.text()`, `f.number()`, or `f.textarea()`. These will display `[object Object]` because JavaScript stringifies the nested object.

## How to Check
```bash
# Look up the actual protobuf type for any field
grep -A 30 "type ModelName struct" go/types/<module>/*.pb.go
```

If a field's Go type starts with `*`, `[]`, or `map[`, it is NOT a simple scalar — it requires special handling.

## What to Do

### If a form factory method already exists for that type → use it
Example: `*erp.Money` → `f.money()`, `*erp.Address` → `f.address()`, `*erp.DateRange` → two `f.date()` calls

### If NO form factory method exists for that type → create one first
1. Add a factory method to `layer8-form-factory.js` that produces the correct `type:` value
2. Add a `case` handler in `layer8d-forms-fields.js` `generateFieldHtml()` to render it
3. Add a `case` handler in `layer8d-forms-data.js` `collectFormData()` to collect it
4. Then use the new factory method in form definitions

### Never work around it by using f.text() or f.textarea()
This will appear to work during development but will display `[object Object]` at runtime.

## Current Type Mappings

| Go Type Pattern | Form Factory | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| `string`, `int32`, `int64`, `float64`, `bool` | `f.text()`, `f.number()`, `f.checkbox()` | Simple scalars — safe |
| `*erp.Money` | `f.money()` | Nested `{amount, currencyCode}` |
| `*erp.Address` | `...f.address('prefix')` | Expands to 6 address fields |
| `*erp.ContactInfo` | `...f.contact('prefix')` | Expands to email + phone |
| `*erp.DateRange` | Two `f.date('parent.startDate/endDate')` | Two timestamps in nested object |
| `*erp.AuditInfo` | `...f.audit()` | Read-only metadata |
| `[]string` | `f.text()` (temporary) | Displays comma-separated; needs future `f.tags()` |
| Any new `*erp.X` | **Create handler first** | Never use scalar fallback |

## Error Symptoms
- `[object Object]` in form field → nested type using scalar form method
- Field empty on edit but table shows data → dot-notation key not resolving
- Save corrupts data → form sends scalar but server expects nested object

# 10. Compound Form Field Data Collection

**Source:** `compound-form-field-data-collection.md`

## Rule
When a form field type renders **multiple sub-elements** with modified names (e.g., `fieldKey.__amount`, `fieldKey.__currencyId`), the data collection code MUST NOT rely on `form.elements[field.key]` to find the element — it won't exist.

## Why This Matters
The standard data collection pattern is:
```javascript
const element = form.elements[field.key];
if (!element) return;  // ← Skips the ENTIRE field silently!
```

For compound fields (like `type: 'money'`), no single element has `name="fieldKey"`. The sub-elements have names like `fieldKey.__amount` and `fieldKey.__currencyId`. The guard silently skips data collection, the server receives no value, and required validation fails with a cryptic error.

## The Trap
This bug is **silent** — no console error, no visible failure during form rendering. The form looks correct, the user fills in values, but on save the server rejects with "Field is required" because the data was never collected.

## Checklist for Compound Field Types
When adding a new compound field type (a field that renders multiple sub-inputs):

1. **Rendering**: Sub-elements use `name="${field.key}.__subField"` convention
2. **Data collection guard**: Add the field type to the guard exception:
   ```javascript
   if (!element && field.type !== 'money' && field.type !== 'newCompoundType') return;
   ```
3. **Data collection case**: Use `form.elements[field.key + '.__subField']` or `form.querySelector()` to find sub-elements directly
4. **Test manually**: After implementing, verify that saving a form with the compound field actually sends the data to the server

## Current Compound Field Types
- `money` — renders `fieldKey.__currencyId` (`<select>`) + `fieldKey.__amount` (formatted input)

## Desktop vs Mobile
- **Desktop** (`layer8d-forms-data.js`): Uses `form.elements[field.key]` lookup — VULNERABLE to this bug
- **Mobile** (`layer8m-forms.js`): Iterates all `input, select, textarea` elements by name — NOT vulnerable (collects all sub-elements, then post-processes compound keys)

---

# 11. Template Literal Ternary Edit Safety

**Source:** `template-literal-ternary-edits.md`

## Rule
When wrapping existing content inside a JavaScript template literal with a conditional expression (`${condition ? \`...\` : ''}`), the Edit tool's `old_string` MUST include enough context to cover BOTH the opening AND closing of the new nesting level. Never add an opening `${condition ? \`` without also editing the corresponding closing to add `` \` : ''}`.

## Why This Is Critical
Template literals can nest (backticks inside `${}`), but every opening backtick needs a matching close. A partial edit that introduces a new nesting level without closing it creates a **syntax error that silently kills the entire JS file** — no console error, no runtime exception, just undefined functions.

## The Dangerous Pattern

### WRONG: Partial edit that only covers the opening
```javascript
// old_string covers lines 5-10
        <div class="section">
            <table>
                <tbody>${items.map(i => `...`).join('')}</tbody>

// new_string wraps in ternary but doesn't close it
        ${items.length > 0 ? `
        <div class="section">
            <table>
                <tbody>${items.map(i => `...`).join('')}</tbody>
```
The existing `</table></div>` and outer closing backtick remain unchanged, so the ternary is never closed with `` ` : ''}`.

### CORRECT: Edit includes enough context to close the ternary
```javascript
// old_string covers lines 5-12 (includes the closing tags)
        <div class="section">
            <table>
                <tbody>${items.map(i => `...`).join('')}</tbody>
            </table>
        </div>

// new_string properly opens AND closes the ternary
        ${items.length > 0 ? `
        <div class="section">
            <table>
                <tbody>${items.map(i => `...`).join('')}</tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
        ` : ''}
```

## Verification
After ANY edit that adds ternary expressions or conditional wrappers inside template literals:
1. **Run `node -c <file>` immediately** to check for syntax errors
2. Count opening `${` and closing `}` — they must match
3. Count backticks — every `` ` `` inside a `${}` expression needs a matching close
4. Verify every ternary `? \`` has a corresponding `` \` : ...}`

## Error Symptoms
- Clicking a button/row does nothing (the handler function is undefined because the file failed to load)
- "X is not a function" in console (if the caller has error handling)
- No visible error at all (the most common case — the file silently fails to parse)
- User reports "I don't see any change" after edits (the edited file isn't loading)

## When This Applies
- Adding null guards around optional HTML sections in template literals
- Wrapping table/div sections in `${array.length > 0 ? \`...\` : ''}` conditionals
- Any edit that introduces new `${}` nesting inside an existing template literal

# 12. Stacked Popup DOM Scoping

**Source:** `stacked-popup-dom-scoping.md`

## Rule
Never use `document.getElementById()` or `document.querySelector()` to find elements inside a popup when the popup system supports stacking (nested modals). Always scope DOM lookups to the **active popup's body**.

## Why This Is Critical
The Layer8DPopup system uses a modal stack. When a child popup opens on top of a parent popup, both exist in the DOM simultaneously. If both popups contain elements with the same ID (e.g., `<form id="layer8d-edit-form">`), `document.getElementById()` returns the **first** one in DOM order — which is the stacked (hidden) parent, not the active child popup. This causes data to be read from or written to the wrong form.

## The Bug Pattern
```javascript
// WRONG — finds the parent form when a child popup is stacked on top
const form = document.getElementById('layer8d-edit-form');
const data = collectFromForm(form); // collects empty/wrong data
```

```javascript
// CORRECT — scopes to the active (topmost) popup
let form = null;
if (typeof Layer8DPopup !== 'undefined') {
    const body = Layer8DPopup.getBody(); // returns topmost non-stacked popup body
    if (body) {
        form = body.querySelector('#layer8d-edit-form');
    }
}
if (!form) {
    form = document.getElementById('layer8d-edit-form'); // fallback when no popup
}
```

## When This Applies
- Any code that reads form data from a popup (collectFormData, getFormData)
- Any code that writes to or manipulates DOM elements inside a popup
- Any code triggered by popup button callbacks (onSave, onShow) that needs to find elements
- Inline table row editors (child popups opened from within a parent edit form)

## Key APIs
- **Desktop**: `Layer8DPopup.getBody()` — returns the topmost non-stacked popup's body element
- **Mobile**: `popup.body` — passed directly to callbacks by `Layer8MPopup`, already scoped correctly

## Error Symptom
- Editing a child row in an inline table and pressing Save/Update results in blanked data
- Form data collected is empty or contains the parent form's values instead of the child form's
- No console errors — the failure is completely silent

---

# 13. Server-Side Pagination Metadata

**Source:** `server-pagination-metadata.md`

## Rule
Server-side paginated responses only return valid metadata (total count, key counts)
on the FIRST page (page 1). Metadata in subsequent page responses MUST be disregarded.

## Why
The server computes aggregate metadata (total counts, status breakdowns) only when
processing page 0 (the first page). Subsequent page responses may include stale,
partial, or zero metadata that does not reflect the actual dataset.

## Implementation Pattern
When processing server responses in pagination code:
- Page 1: Read and store metadata (totalItems, key counts)
- Page 2+: Preserve existing metadata, only update the data items

## What Resets to Page 1 (and triggers fresh metadata)
- Filter changes
- Sort changes (if server-side)
- Base where clause changes
- Page size changes
- Initial load

# 14. UI Module Integration Checklist

**Source:** `ui-module-integration.md`

## Rule
When implementing a new ERP module, the UI integration is NOT complete until ALL of the following files are created/updated. Do not mark the module as complete until this checklist is verified.

## Required Steps for Desktop UI

### 1. Section HTML File
- **File**: `go/erp/ui/web/sections/<module>.html`
- Must contain the full module structure (NOT a placeholder)
- Must include: header with SVG illustration, module tabs, service navigation, table containers
- Use existing sections (crm.html, hcm.html) as templates

### 2. Section Initializer
- **File**: `go/erp/ui/web/js/sections.js`
- Add module to `sectionInitializers` object:
  ```javascript
  <module>: () => {
      if (typeof initialize<Module> === 'function') {
          initialize<Module>();
      }
  },
  ```

### 3. Module CSS
- **File**: `go/erp/ui/web/<module>/<module>.css`
- Include module-specific accent color for header and active states
- Include status/priority/type color classes as needed

### 4. Reference Registry
- **File**: `go/erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-<module>.js`
- Must be included in `app.html`

### 5. app.html Updates
All of the following must be added to `go/erp/ui/web/app.html`:

#### CSS Include (in `<head>` section)
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<module>/<module>.css">
```

#### Reference Registry Include (after other reference registries)
```html
<script src="js/reference-registry-<module>.js"></script>
```

#### Module Scripts (after other module scripts, before SYS Module)
```html
<!-- <MODULE> Module -->
<script src="<module>/<module>-config.js"></script>
<script src="<module>/<submodule1>/<submodule1>-enums.js"></script>
<script src="<module>/<submodule1>/<submodule1>-columns.js"></script>
<script src="<module>/<submodule1>/<submodule1>-forms.js"></script>
<script src="<module>/<submodule1>/<submodule1>.js"></script>
<!-- ... repeat for all submodules ... -->
<script src="<module>/<module>-init.js"></script>
```

## Verification Commands

After implementation, verify with:
```bash
# Check section HTML is not a placeholder
grep -l "under development" go/erp/ui/web/sections/<module>.html && echo "ERROR: Placeholder still present"

# Check section initializer exists
grep "<module>:" go/erp/ui/web/js/sections.js

# Check CSS is included in app.html
grep "<module>/<module>.css" go/erp/ui/web/app.html

# Check reference registry is included
grep "reference-registry-<module>.js" go/erp/ui/web/app.html

# Check module scripts are included
grep "<module>-init.js" go/erp/ui/web/app.html
```

## Common Mistake
Creating the submodule JS files (enums, columns, forms) but forgetting to:
- Update the section HTML from placeholder to actual content
- Add section initializer to sections.js
- Add script includes to app.html
- Create and include the CSS file

This results in the module appearing in navigation but showing "under development" or not functioning when clicked.

# 15. Module Init sectionSelector Must Match defaultModule

**Source:** `module-init-section-selector.md`

## Rule
In `*-init.js` files that use `Layer8DModuleFactory.create()`, the `sectionSelector` property MUST match the `defaultModule` property value.

## Why This Matters
The navigation code in `layer8d-module-navigation.js` searches for the section container using:
```javascript
document.querySelector(`.hcm-module-content[data-module="${config.sectionSelector}"]`)
```

The `data-module` attributes in the HTML correspond to submodule names (e.g., `planning`, `resources`, `opportunities`), NOT the section name (e.g., `projects`, `crm`).

If `sectionSelector` doesn't match any `data-module` attribute in the HTML, the module will fail to initialize with the error:
```
<Module> section container not found
```

## Correct Pattern

```javascript
// CORRECT - sectionSelector matches defaultModule
Layer8DModuleFactory.create({
    namespace: 'Prj',
    defaultModule: 'planning',        // <-- These must match
    defaultService: 'projects',
    sectionSelector: 'planning',      // <-- These must match
    initializerName: 'initializePrj',
    requiredNamespaces: [...]
});
```

```javascript
// WRONG - sectionSelector uses section name instead of module name
Layer8DModuleFactory.create({
    namespace: 'Prj',
    defaultModule: 'planning',
    defaultService: 'projects',
    sectionSelector: 'projects',      // <-- WRONG: 'projects' is the section, not the module
    initializerName: 'initializePrj',
    requiredNamespaces: [...]
});
```

## Verification
When creating a module init file, verify:
1. `sectionSelector` === `defaultModule`
2. The HTML has `<div class="hcm-module-content" data-module="${sectionSelector}">`

## Examples from Existing Modules

| Module | defaultModule | sectionSelector |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| CRM    | opportunities | opportunities   |
| PRJ    | planning      | planning        |
| HCM    | core-hr       | core-hr         |
| FIN    | general-ledger| general-ledger  |

# 16. Reference Registry Completeness

**Source:** `reference-registry-completeness.md`

## Rule
Every model used as a `lookupModel` in form definitions MUST have a corresponding entry in the reference registry. Forms with unregistered lookupModels will fail silently or show console warnings.

## When This Applies
- When creating or modifying `*-forms.js` files
- When adding new `type: 'reference'` fields to forms
- When creating a new ERP module with reference lookups

## Required Actions

### Before Adding a Reference Field
Before adding a field like this to a form:
```javascript
{ key: 'customerId', label: 'Customer', type: 'reference', lookupModel: 'Customer' }
```

Verify the model exists in the reference registry:
```bash
grep -r "Customer:" go/erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-*.js
```

### If Model is NOT Registered
Add it to the appropriate reference registry file:

**Desktop:** `go/erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-<module>.js`
```javascript
...refModule.simple('Customer', 'customerId', 'name', 'Customer'),
```

**Mobile:** `go/erp/ui/web/l8ui/m/js/layer8m-reference-registry-<module>.js`
```javascript
Customer: {
    idColumn: 'customerId',
    displayColumn: 'name',
    selectColumns: ['customerId', 'name'],
    displayLabel: 'Customer'
},
```

### Reference Registry Entry Requirements
Each entry must have:
- `idColumn`: The primary key field name (from protobuf)
- `displayColumn`: Field to show in the picker
- `selectColumns`: Fields to fetch for display
- `displayLabel`: Human-readable name (optional but recommended)
- `displayFormat`: Custom format function (optional, for complex displays)

## Verification Commands

### Check for Missing Registrations
```bash
# Get all lookupModel values used in forms
grep -rh "lookupModel: '" go/erp/ui/web --include="*-forms.js" | \
  sed "s/.*lookupModel: '\\([^']*\\)'.*/\\1/" | sort -u > /tmp/used.txt

# Get all registered models
grep -rhoE "(simple|coded|batch|batchIdOnly|idOnly|person)\\(['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" \
  go/erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-*.js | \
  sed "s/.*(['\"]\\([^'\"]*\\)['\"].*/\\1/" | sort -u > /tmp/registered.txt

# Find missing
comm -23 /tmp/used.txt /tmp/registered.txt
```

### Verify a Specific Model
```bash
grep -r "ModelName:" go/erp/ui/web/js/reference-registry-*.js
```

## Common Patterns

### Simple Model (most common)
```javascript
...ref.simple('ModelName', 'primaryKeyId', 'displayField', 'Label'),
```

### Model with Code + Name Display
```javascript
...ref.coded('ModelName', 'primaryKeyId', 'code', 'name'),
```

### Person Model (firstName + lastName)
```javascript
...ref.person('ModelName', 'primaryKeyId'),
```

### ID-Only Model (no display needed)
```javascript
...ref.idOnly('ModelName', 'primaryKeyId'),
```

## Checklist for New Modules

When creating a new module:
1. [ ] Create `reference-registry-<module>.js` for desktop
2. [ ] Create `layer8m-reference-registry-<module>.js` for mobile
3. [ ] Add script includes to `app.html` and `m/app.html`
4. [ ] Register all models that will be used as lookupModel
5. [ ] Update merge file if using split pattern (e.g., `reference-registry-mfg-sales.js`)
6. [ ] Run verification command to confirm no missing registrations

## Error Symptom
```
Reference input missing required config: fieldName
```
This console warning means the lookupModel for that field is not in the reference registry.

# 17. Mobile Parity

**Source:** `mobile-parity.md`

## Rule
Every UI feature must have **functional parity** between desktop and mobile. This means not just the UI element, but also its **behavioral effects** on the rest of the application.

### 1. When Implementing a New Feature
Before marking any UI task as complete, verify the feature works on both desktop (`go/erp/ui/web/`) and mobile (`go/erp/ui/web/m/`). If only one side was implemented, implement the other before moving on.

### 2. When Touching Any Section or Module
Whenever you modify or work on a section (e.g., System, HCM, Financial), audit the **entire section** for desktop/mobile parity gaps before finishing. Compare:
- Desktop section HTML (`sections/<module>.html`) vs mobile section HTML (`m/sections/<module>.html`)
- Desktop JS features (detail popups, tabs, interactive elements) vs mobile equivalents
- Script includes in `app.html` vs `m/app.html`

If you find gaps, flag them to the user and offer to fix them.

### 3. Behavioral Effects (CRITICAL)
A feature includes **all its downstream effects**, not just the UI element itself. When implementing a feature, trace its effects across the entire application on BOTH platforms.

Examples:
- **Module enable/disable**: The toggle tree UI exists on both platforms. But does disabling a module actually HIDE it from navigation on both platforms? Check sidebar, dashboard cards, sub-module tabs, and service cards.
- **Configuration changes**: If a settings page changes behavior (e.g., currency selection, theme), does the change propagate to all UI components on both platforms?
- **Data operations**: If a CRUD operation on one view affects what's shown in another view, does that cross-view effect work on both platforms?

**Ask yourself**: "If a user performs this action on mobile, will the result be identical to performing it on desktop?" If not, there's a parity gap.

## Verification Checklist
When working on a section, ask yourself:
1. Does the desktop version have detail popups? Does mobile?
2. Does the desktop version have interactive features (sorting, filtering, tabs)? Does mobile?
3. Are all shared scripts included in both `app.html` and `m/app.html`?
4. Are section HTML files placeholders ("Under Development") on one side but functional on the other?
5. **Does the feature's EFFECT propagate to all navigation and display components on both platforms?**
6. **Do shared components (Layer8DModuleFilter, Layer8DUtils, etc.) get consumed by both desktop and mobile navigation?**

## Why This Matters
Parity is not just "does the same button exist on both platforms." It is "does the same action produce the same result on both platforms." A settings page that renders identically on both platforms but only affects desktop navigation is NOT at parity — the behavioral effect is missing on mobile.

# 18. Mock Data Generation

**Source:** `mock-data-generation.md`

## Location
All mock data files live in `go/tests/mocks/`. The system generates phased, dependency-ordered mock data with realistic ("flavorable") distributions.

## Prerequisites
- Module protobuf types exist in `go/types/<module>/`
- Module service area number is known (HCM=10, FIN=40, SCM=50)

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Read the new module's protobuf files
- Identify all structs (models), their exact field names/types, and enums
- Note cross-module references (fields pointing to HCM employees, FIN vendors, etc.)
- Pay close attention to actual field names — they often differ from what you'd guess (e.g., `RmaId` not `AuthorizationId`)

### Step 2: Determine phase ordering
- Group models by dependency: foundation objects first, then objects that reference them
- Typically 5-10 phases per module
- Foundation (no deps) -> Core entities -> Dependent objects -> Transactions -> Planning/Analytics

### Step 3: Add module data arrays to `data.go`
- Curated name arrays for realistic variety (category names, entity names, etc.)
- Place after existing module data with a comment header

### Step 4: Add ID slices to `store.go`
- One `[]string` per model in the `MockDataStore` struct, grouped by phase with comments
- Use module prefix for names that could collide with other modules (e.g., `SCMWarehouseIDs`, `SCMCarrierIDs`)

### Step 5: Create generator files (parallelizable)
- One file per logical group (e.g., `gen_<module>_foundation.go`, `gen_<module>_inventory.go`)
- Each file must stay under 500 lines
- Each function signature: `func generate<Models>(store *MockDataStore) []*<module>.<Model>`
  - Foundation generators with no store deps use: `func generate<Models>() []*<module>.<Model>`
- Patterns to follow:
  - Allocate slice, loop with flavorable distributions (e.g., 60% APPROVED status)
  - `createAuditInfo()` for all audit fields
  - `&erp.Money{Amount: <cents>, CurrencyCode: "USD"}` for monetary fields
  - `time.Unix()` / `.Unix()` for date fields
  - `&erp.DateRange{StartDate: ..., EndDate: ...}` for date ranges
  - Reference `store.*IDs` with modulo indexing for cross-model/cross-module links
  - ID format: `fmt.Sprintf("<prefix>-%03d", i+1)`
- These files can all be created in parallel since they have no interdependencies

### Step 6: Create phase orchestration files
- `<module>_phases.go` (and `<module>_phases<N>_<M>.go` if needed to stay under 500 lines)
- Each phase function:
  1. Calls the generator function
  2. Posts to `/erp/<serviceArea>/<ServiceName>` using `client.post()` with the `*List` wrapper type
  3. Appends returned IDs to `store.*IDs`
  4. Prints count
- ServiceName must be 10 characters or less

### Step 7: Update `main.go`
- Add phase calls after existing modules (with Printf headers)
- Add summary Printf section at the end showing key entity counts

### Step 8: Build and verify
- `go build ./tests/mocks/` and `go vet ./tests/mocks/`
- Most common error: proto field names differ from expectations — always verify against the `.pb.go` files

## Key Patterns

### Flavorable distributions
- Use proportional status assignment: e.g., first 60% get APPROVED, next 20% get IN_PROGRESS, rest cycle through remaining statuses
- Random but bounded values: `rand.Intn(max-min) + min`
- Money amounts in cents: `int64(rand.Intn(rangeSize) + minimum)`

### Cross-module references
- HCM: `EmployeeIDs`, `ManagerIDs`, `DepartmentIDs` (for managers, requesters, assignees)
- FIN: `VendorIDs` (for procurement, suppliers), `CustomerIDs` (for shipments, returns)
- Always check `len(store.*IDs) > 0` before accessing when the dependency is optional

### File naming convention
- Generator files: `gen_<module>_<group>.go`
- Phase files: `<module>_phases.go`, `<module>_phases<N>_<M>.go`

# 19. Mock Data Completeness

**Source:** `mock-completeness.md`

## Rule
When implementing mock data generators for a module, ALL services in that module MUST have corresponding mock data generators. No service should be left without mock data.

## Why This Matters
Incomplete mock data causes confusion during testing and development. Users see some tables populated and others empty, leading to debugging sessions to figure out if it's a bug or missing mock data.

## Verification Process

### Before Implementation
1. **List all services in the module**:
   ```bash
   ls -la go/erp/<module>/
   ```

2. **Extract service names from the directories**:
   Each subdirectory represents a service that needs mock data.

3. **Cross-reference with UI config**:
   Check `go/erp/ui/web/<module>/<module>-config.js` to see all services defined in the UI.

### During Implementation
Create a checklist of all services and mark them as you implement.

### After Implementation
1. **Verify store.go has ID slices for all entities**:
   ```bash
   grep "<Module>.*IDs" go/tests/mocks/store.go
   ```

2. **Verify all generators exist**:
   ```bash
   grep "func generate<Module>" go/tests/mocks/gen_<module>*.go
   ```

3. **Verify all phase calls exist**:
   ```bash
   grep "client.post.*/<serviceArea>/" go/tests/mocks/<module>_phases*.go
   ```

4. **Count services vs generators**:
   ```bash
   # Count services
   ls -d go/erp/<module>/*/ | wc -l

   # Count generators (should match)
   grep -c "func generate<Module>" go/tests/mocks/gen_<module>*.go
   ```

## Common Patterns That Lead to Missing Generators

### 1. Line Items
When a parent entity has line items, both need generators:
- SalesOrder → SalesOrderLine
- SalesReturnOrder → SalesReturnOrderLine (often missed!)
- SalesQuotation → SalesQuotationLine

### 2. Secondary/Support Entities
These are often overlooked:
- Allocations (OrderAllocation, InventoryAllocation)
- Back orders
- Confirmations (DeliveryConfirm, ReceivingConfirm)
- Break tables (QuantityBreak, PriceBreak)

### 3. Junction/Assignment Tables
- TerritoryAssign
- EmployeeSkill
- CourseEnrollment

## Generator File Organization

Organize generators by functional area to make completeness easier to verify:

```
gen_<module>_foundation.go    - Base/master data
gen_<module>_<area1>.go       - First functional area
gen_<module>_<area2>.go       - Second functional area
...
```

## Phase Organization

Group related entities in the same phase for dependency management:

```
Phase 1: Foundation (no dependencies)
Phase 2: Core entities (depend on foundation)
Phase 3: Configuration (depend on core)
Phase 4: Transactions (depend on configuration)
Phase 5: Line items (depend on transactions)
Phase 6+: Additional areas
```

## Checklist Before PR

- [ ] All services in `go/erp/<module>/` have generators
- [ ] All services in UI config have generators
- [ ] store.go has ID slices for all entities

# 20. Mock Endpoint Construction

**Source:** `mock-endpoint-construction.md`

## Endpoint Format
Mock endpoints must follow this exact format:
```
/erp/{ServiceArea}/{ServiceName}
```

## Finding the Correct ServiceName
The `ServiceName` constant is defined in each service's `*Service.go` file. Before writing a mock endpoint:

1. Locate the service file: `go/erp/{module}/{servicedir}/*Service.go`
2. Find the `ServiceName` constant (typically around line 30)
3. Use that exact value in the endpoint

## Example
For Sales Territory service:
```go
// In go/erp/sales/salesterritories/SalesTerritoryService.go
const (
    ServiceName = "Territory"  // <-- Use this value
    ServiceArea = byte(60)
)
```

Mock endpoint should be:
```go
client.post("/erp/60/Territory", &sales.SalesTerritoryList{...})
```

**NOT** `/erp/60/SalesTerritory` (incorrect - doesn't match ServiceName)

## ServiceName Constraint
ServiceName must be 10 characters or less (per maintainability.md). This is why names are abbreviated:
- `Territory` not `SalesTerritory`
- `DlvryOrder` not `DeliveryOrder`
- `CustSegmt` not `CustomerSegment`

## Verification Checklist
Before creating mock phase files:
1. Run: `grep "ServiceName = " go/erp/{module}/**/*Service.go` to list all service names
2. Cross-reference each mock endpoint against the grep output
3. Ensure exact match between endpoint path segment and ServiceName constant

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using the type name (e.g., `SalesTerritory`) instead of ServiceName (`Territory`)
- Guessing abbreviated names instead of checking the actual constant
- Forgetting that ServiceName has a 10-character limit

# 21. Mock Phase Ordering

**Source:** `mock-phase-ordering.md`

## Rule
When adding server-side validation (e.g., `ValidateRequired`) for a foreign key field, you MUST verify that the mock data phase ordering ensures the referenced entity's IDs are populated BEFORE any generator that uses them.

## Why This Matters
Mock generators use `pickRef(store.XxxIDs, index)` to reference entities from other modules. If `store.XxxIDs` is empty (because the referenced module hasn't run yet), `pickRef` returns `""`, and any `ValidateRequired` check on that field will fail with "XxxId is required".

## The `pickRef` Trap
```go
func pickRef(ids []string, index int) string {
    if len(ids) == 0 {
        return ""  // ← Silent empty string, not an error!
    }
    return ids[index%len(ids)]
}
```

`pickRef` does NOT panic or warn when the slice is empty. It silently returns an empty string, which passes Go compilation but fails server validation at runtime.

## Current Module Phase Order (in `main_phases.go`)

FIN and HCM have a circular dependency, resolved by splitting FIN:
```
1. FIN Foundation (Phases 1-3) — CurrencyIDs, FiscalYearIDs, Accounts, Vendors, Customers
2. HCM (all phases)            — EmployeeIDs, DepartmentIDs (needs CurrencyIDs)
3. FIN Remaining (Phases 4-9)  — Budgets, AP, AR, GL, Assets, Tax (needs DepartmentIDs, EmployeeIDs)
4. SCM
5. Sales
6. MFG
7. CRM
8. PRJ
9. BI
10. DOC
11. ECOM
12. COMP
```

## Why FIN is Split
- FIN Phases 1-3: No HCM dependency. Provides CurrencyIDs needed by ALL modules.
- FIN Phase 4 (`gen_fin_config.go`): Uses `store.DepartmentIDs` for Budgets.
- FIN Phase 8 (`gen_fin_assets.go`): Uses `store.EmployeeIDs` and `store.DepartmentIDs`.
- HCM: Uses `store.CurrencyIDs` in gen_compensation.go, gen_payroll.go, gen_benefits.go, gen_employee_data.go.

**When splitting modules like this, use `runXxxFoundation()` and `runXxxRemaining()` in `main_phases_modules*.go`.**

## Checklist When Adding Required Validation

Before adding `common.ValidateRequired(entity.SomeId, "SomeId")` to a service callback:

1. **Identify which module generates the referenced IDs** (e.g., CurrencyIDs come from FIN)
2. **Check `main_phases.go`** to confirm that module runs BEFORE the module being validated
3. **Check mock generators** for the validated entity — verify they set the field using `pickRef(store.XxxIDs, ...)`
4. **If the referenced module runs AFTER**, either:
   - Reorder modules in `main_phases.go` (preferred if no circular dependency)
   - Move the referenced entity generation to an earlier cross-module bootstrap phase

## Common Cross-Module Dependencies
| Field | Source Module | Source Phase | Used By |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| CurrencyIDs | FIN | Phase 1 | ALL modules (via Money fields) |
| EmployeeIDs | HCM | Phase 1-3 | FIN 8, CRM, PRJ, MFG, Sales |
| DepartmentIDs | HCM | Phase 1 | FIN 4+8, PRJ, MFG |
| VendorIDs | FIN | Phase 2 | SCM, MFG |
| CustomerIDs | FIN | Phase 2 | Sales, ECOM, CRM |
| ItemIDs | SCM | Phase 1 | Sales, MFG, ECOM |

## Direct Index Access Trap
Some generators use `store.XxxIDs[i]` or `store.XxxIDs[0]` (direct index, not `pickRef`). These will **panic** with "index out of range" if the slice is empty, rather than silently returning "". Both patterns are dangerous but panics are at least immediately visible.

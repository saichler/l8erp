# Code Maintainability Standards

## File Size
Files that are over 500 lines of code are not maintainable, please make sure to refactor them and break them into smaller files logically.

## No Duplicate Code
Avoid duplicate code. Always check for existing utilities, functions, or components before writing new code. Consolidate duplicates into shared modules.

## Future-Proof Design
The ERP system has more modules that are not implemented yet. When designing components, consider that future modules (Financial, SCM, Manufacturing, Sales, CRM, Projects, BI, Documents, E-Commerce, Compliance, System) will follow similar patterns. Design shared components to be reusable across all modules.

## Read Before Implementing
When asked to implement something similar to an existing component, you MUST read ALL the code of the referenced component(s) first. Do not make any assumptions. Read every file, understand every pattern, and only then implement following the exact same patterns.
- Use the Read tool to read the file completely. Show the key interfaces and props found. Then implement.

## Component Integration Analysis
When implementing support for a component, perform deep analysis first:
- Understand all initialization arguments and configuration options
- Understand how endpoints are constructed (if applicable)
- Understand how L8Query is constructed for paging, filtering, and sorting (if supported)
- Only proceed with implementation after full understanding is documented

## Demo Directory
The `/go/demo/` directory is auto-generated and used for local testing only. Do not edit code in that directory. The source of truth is `/go/erp/ui/web/`.

## ServiceName
ServiceName should not be larger than 10 characters.

## ServiceArea
ServiceArea should be the same for Services under the same Module.

## Guidelines
- Target file size: under 500 lines of code
- Each file should have a single responsibility
- Refactor proactively when approaching the 500-line threshold
- Use logical module/package organization
- Check for existing shared utilities before creating new ones

## Duplication Prevention Rules

### Second Instance Rule
When creating a second instance of any pattern (e.g., a second module, a second similar component), extract a shared abstraction immediately. Do not copy a file and replace identifiers. The second consumer is the forcing function for abstraction — do not wait for a third.

### Copy-Paste Detection
If the only differences between two files are identifiers, names, or configuration values, the logic MUST be extracted into a shared component that accepts those values as parameters. Before creating a new module or feature file, diff it against the nearest equivalent. If the diff shows only namespace changes (e.g., `HCM` to `FIN`), string literal changes, or data differences — the logic is generic and must be shared.

### Configuration vs. Logic Separation
Module-specific files should contain only data (configuration, definitions, mappings). All behavioral logic (CRUD operations, navigation, service lookups, DOM manipulation, event handlers, fetch calls) must live in shared components. A module consists of:
- A config file (unique data)
- Data files (enums, columns, forms — unique per sub-module)
- An init file that calls a shared factory (~10 lines)

### Shared Components Before the Second Module
The shared abstraction layer must be created as part of building the first module, or at latest refactored out before the second module ships. Never ship a second module by copying the first. If the first module embedded behavioral logic, the second module's implementation must include extracting that logic into shared components.

### New Module Checklist
Before creating a new module, verify it only needs configuration files:
- Does it need its own navigation logic? → No, use the shared navigation component.
- Does it need its own CRUD handlers? → No, use the shared CRUD component.
- Does it need its own form wrapper? → No, use the shared form framework.
- Does it need its own service lookup? → No, use the shared service registry.
If any answer is "yes," fix the shared component — do not work around it with a module-specific copy.

### Audit on Every Module Addition
When adding a new module, diff all existing module-level files. Any file with >80% similarity across modules is a refactoring candidate that MUST be addressed before the new module ships.

### Facades Are a Code Smell
If a wrapper file delegates 100% of its calls to another component, it should not exist. Delete it and reference the shared component directly. A file that only re-exports or proxies another component is dead weight.

### Backport Improvements Immediately
When a newer module improves on a pattern from an older module, the improvement must be backported to all existing modules immediately. Do not leave different implementations of the same logic across modules.

### Measure Boilerplate
If adding a new module requires more than 50 lines of structural/behavioral code (excluding domain-specific data like configs, enums, columns, forms), the shared abstraction layer needs improvement before proceeding.

### Document the Module Creation Recipe
Maintain a "How to Add a New Module" guide that specifies exactly which files to create and which shared components to use. If the guide says "copy an existing module," the architecture has failed. The guide should say: create config, create data files, create init file with a factory call. No copying. No behavioral code. Configuration only.
